# Configuration

## What is this?

`config.yaml` at this repo's root holds the settings for the **inference layer** —
which AI gateway to use, which KServe and LiteLLM versions to install, hostnames, and
the cluster's CPU-pinning policy.

The core installer loads it as Ansible extra vars:

```
-e @ext/enterprise.ai-inference/config.yaml
```

### How it fits together

Three layers, each overriding the one before it:

```
roles/<name>/defaults/main.yaml     role defaults — the baseline
        ↓
config.yaml  (this repo)            inference-layer settings
        ↓
env/<name>/global_config.yaml       platform settings (base_domain_name, auth_provider, …)
        ↓
-e on the command line              one-off override
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `config.yaml` is checked into this repo, so it applies to **every** environment.
> Anything environment-specific — domain, auth provider, storage — belongs in the
> platform's `env/<name>/global_config.yaml` instead. See the
> [solutions Configuration Reference](https://github.com/intel/enterprise-ai-solutions/blob/main/docs/customize/configuration.md).

### Do I need to change anything?

No. The defaults deploy a working inference stack. Reach for this file when:

| If you want to… | Change |
|---|---|
| Use agentgateway instead of Envoy AI Gateway | `ai_gateway_provider: "agentgateway"` |
| Auto-deploy catalog models during install | `llm_services_deploy_models: true` |
| Make an auto-deploy failure abort the install | `model_deploy_strict: true` |
| Pin a component version | `kserve_version`, `litellm_version`, `envoy_ai_gateway_version` |
| Change a service hostname | `inference_hostname`, `litellm_hostname`, `langfuse_hostname` |
| Change CPU pinning behaviour | `kubernetes_cpu_policy` |
| Serve models from a different namespace | `llm_services_namespace` |

## AI gateway

Which in-cluster AI gateway sits behind the edge gateway and dispatches to the KServe
model backends. Both speak the OpenAI protocol on the same unified URL and route to
`InferencePool`/`Service` backends — only the data plane and CRDs differ.

```yaml
ai_gateway_provider: "envoy"          # envoy | agentgateway
```

| Value | What it deploys |
|---|---|
| `envoy` (default) | Envoy AI Gateway — `AIGatewayRoute` CRDs, EPP endpoint picker |
| `agentgateway` | agentgateway — native Gateway API `HTTPRoute` → `InferencePool`, plus MCP / A2A support for the agentic layer |

```yaml
# Envoy AI Gateway (when ai_gateway_provider=envoy)
envoy_ai_gateway_version: "0.6.0"
envoy_ai_gateway_namespace: "envoy-ai-gateway-system"

# agentgateway (when ai_gateway_provider=agentgateway)
# agentgateway_version: "1.3.1"
# agentgateway_namespace: "agentgateway-system"
```

## Hostnames

Every hostname defaults to a prefix on the platform's `base_domain_name`.

| Setting | Default | Serves |
|---|---|---|
| `inference_hostname` | `inference.<base_domain_name>` | Model API in `keycloak` mode |
| `inference_prefix` | `inference` | Prefix used when `inference_hostname` is unset |
| `litellm_hostname` | `litellm.<base_domain_name>` | Model API in `litellm` mode |
| `langfuse_hostname` | `langfuse.<base_domain_name>` | Langfuse UI |

> [!NOTE]
> The two auth modes serve on **different** hostnames. See
> [Accessing Models](../deploy/accessing_models.md).

## Keycloak

The realm and client are owned by this solution; Keycloak itself is deployed by the
platform.

```yaml
keycloak_realm: "inference"
keycloak_client_id: "inference-client"
# keycloak_token_lifespan: 900   # JWT access token lifespan in seconds (default: 15 min)
```

These roles run only when `auth_provider` is not `litellm`.

## KServe

```yaml
# kserve_version: "0.15.1"
# kserve_deploy_mode: "Standard"     # Standard | Knative
# kserve_namespace: "kserve"
```

KServe runs in **Standard** mode — direct pod-based serving. It requires cert-manager and
Envoy Gateway, both installed by the core platform. Standard is the validated and
supported mode.

## LiteLLM and Langfuse

Deployed only when `auth_provider: litellm`.

```yaml
# litellm_version: "v1.83.14-stable.patch.2"
# litellm_namespace: "litellm"
# litellm_cache_enabled: true
# litellm_cache_ttl: 600

# langfuse_namespace: "langfuse"
# langfuse_admin_email: "admin@<base_domain_name>"
# langfuse_admin_password: set via the LANGFUSE_ADMIN_PASSWORD env var
```

The LiteLLM master key is generated at install and stored in the `litellm-master-key`
secret in the `litellm` namespace. Langfuse's admin password comes from the
`LANGFUSE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable, not from this file.

## CPU policy

A single switch controlling all CPU-pinning infrastructure. Dependent settings — NRI
install, kubelet flags, model annotations — are derived from it.

```yaml
kubernetes_cpu_policy: "nri-balloons"   # nri-balloons | kubelet-static | best-effort
```

| Value | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `nri-balloons` (default) | NRI balloons resource policy — NUMA-aware pinning |
| `kubelet-static` | kubelet static CPU manager — Guaranteed QoS pinning |
| `best-effort` | No pinning, standard scheduler |

> [!WARNING]
> This must match the value the cluster was **installed** with. It decides both how
> kubelet is configured (solutions repo) and how model manifests are rendered (this
> repo). Changing it on an existing cluster requires re-running
> `./es_auto_installer.sh install kubernetes` so kubelet is reconfigured.

Tuning, per policy:

```yaml
# nri-balloons only
# nri_reserved_cpu_list: ""            # Linux cpuset for system CPUs (auto-sized if empty)
# nri_deployment_profile: "standard"   # minimal(8) | standard(12) | observability(16) | full(20)

# kubelet-static only
# mm_kubelet_threads_per_core: 1       # set to 1 on an SMT-disabled cluster
```

Under `kubelet-static`, model pods are rendered as Guaranteed QoS (integer `cpu`,
requests == limits) so kubelet's static CPU manager grants them exclusive whole cores.
With `full-pcpus-only` enabled (the solutions default) a pod's `cpu` request must be a
multiple of the SMT width or kubelet rejects it with `SMTAlignmentError`; model-manager
rounds `cpu` up to satisfy this.

Full detail → [CPU Pinning & NUMA](../reference/cpu_pinning.md).

## LLM services and model deployment

```yaml
# llm_services_namespace: "llm-inference"
# llm_services_deploy_runtimes: true   # deploy namespace-scoped ServingRuntimes

llm_services_deploy_models: false      # run the model auto-deploy phase
# model_deploy_strict: false           # true = an auto-deploy failure aborts the install
# model_deploy_flags: ""               # extra flags for every auto-deploy invocation
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `llm_services_deploy_models` ships as **`false`**, overriding the role default of
> `true`. It gates the whole auto-deploy phase, so flagging a model `autodeploy: true`
> has no effect until you also set this to `true`. See
> [Auto-deploy on install](catalog.md#auto-deploy-on-install).

`llm_services_deploy_runtimes` deploys `files/runtimes/*.yaml` as namespace-scoped
`ServingRuntime`s. These are needed for `InferenceService` CRs (OpenVINO);
`LLMInferenceService` CRs (vLLM) ignore them.

`model_deploy_flags` is appended to each `model-manager deploy <name> --wait` invocation
during auto-deploy — e.g. `"--wait-timeout 1800"` to allow longer for large models, or
`"--dry-run"` to render manifests without applying.

## Node Feature Discovery

```yaml
# nfd_enabled: true
# nfd_namespace: "node-feature-discovery"
# nfd_version: "0.17.1"
```

NFD runs as a DaemonSet and labels every node with its hardware capabilities:

```
feature.node.kubernetes.io/cpu-security.amx.enabled=true
feature.node.kubernetes.io/cpu-cpuid.AVX512F=true
feature.node.kubernetes.io/memory-numa.node_count=2
```

model-manager consumes these in `nodeAffinity` rules — notably the catalog's
`require_amx: true` default, which keeps model pods off nodes without Intel® AMX.
Disabling NFD means those affinity rules cannot be satisfied.

## Environment variables

`model-manager` reads these at runtime. The commonly useful ones:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `HF_TOKEN` | Hugging Face token for gated models |
| `MM_CONFIG` | Path to the model catalog (`models.yaml`) |
| `MM_GLOBAL_CONFIG` | Path to the platform's `global_config.yaml` |
| `MM_INFERENCE_HOSTNAME` | Override the resolved endpoint hostname in either auth mode |
| `MM_CPU_POLICY` | Override `kubernetes_cpu_policy` for one invocation |
| `MM_NRI_ENABLED` | Set `false` to skip NRI CPU-pinning annotations |
| `MM_NRI_PREFLIGHT` | `warn` — report a capacity shortfall but proceed |
| `MM_NRI_SKIP_PREFLIGHT` | `1` — skip the capacity check entirely |
| `MM_FORCE_REDEPLOY` | `1` — re-apply a model even if its rendered spec is unchanged |
| `MM_HTTP_PROXY` / `MM_HTTPS_PROXY` / `MM_NO_PROXY` | Proxy settings for the download job |
| `SKIP_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT` | `true` — skip the auto-deploy phase for one install run |

Run `./model-manager --help` for the full surface.
